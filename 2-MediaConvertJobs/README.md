# Module 2: AWS Elemental MediaConvert Jobs

Whether you are working with video for a web application, an Over the Top (OTT, i.e. via the internet) platform, or for broadcast cable, you will need to deliver the video in some standard format that ensures a high quality and consistent experience to viewers. Broadcast and OTT video platforms, such as cable TV channels and Apple TV, specify, in detail, the video features, packaging and encoding that their platforms can decode and play out.  MediaConvert provides the mechanism for converting videos to formats that conform to these policies. 

Example of an OTT video standard:
    
* The [HLS Authoring Specification for Apple Devices](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/HLSAuthoringSpec/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016596) gives details about the component outputs of adaptive bitrate stacks supported by Apple devices including information about codecs, bitrates, and resolutions they support.

Example of a broadcast video standard:

* The [CableLabs Mezzanine Encoding Specification](https://apps.cablelabs.com/specification/mezzanine-encoding-specification) specifies a standard for encoding and packaging for video content that will be exchanged and reused by downstream workflows.   For example, you might choose this standard if you wanted to archive news videos in a content management system and then resell them to downstream consumers. 

In this module, you'll use AWS Elemental MediaConvert to convert videos into different formats that enable efficient storage, distribution, and reuse of a video in a variety of workflows.  You'll learn how to use MediaConvert to convert a video into output formats suitable for both file-based and adaptive bitrate, streaming playout, as well as creating thumbnails of the video.

## Prerequisites

You need to have access to MediaConvert and S3 to complete this module. 

You need the following resources created in module 1:
* **MediaConvertRole** - the role created to give permission for MediaConvert to access resources in your account.
* **MediaBucket** - the bucket created to store outputs from MediaConvert

If you used CloudFormation to configure resources, you will find the values names of MediaConvertRole and MediaBucket in the Outputs of the CloudFormation stack.


## 1. Create a MediaConvert Job

A MediaConvert job reads an input video from S3 and converts the video to multiple output groups that in turn can have multiple outputs.  A single media convert job can create multiple versions of the input video in different codecs and packages. 

In this module, you will create a MediaConvert job that take a single input video and converts the video into three output groups as shown in the diagram below:

![media convert job](../images/mediaconvert-job.png)

**Apple HLS Group** - this is an example of an _adaptive bitrate stack_ that encodes the source into multiple files at different data rates and divides them into short chunks, usually between 5-10 seconds long. These are loaded onto an HTTP server along with a text-based manifest file with a .M3U8 extension that directs the player to additional manifest files for each of the encoded streams.  

**File Group - MP4** - this group produces a single MP4 file that must be downloaded entirely by the player for decoding and playback.  MP4 is a common _mezzanine_ (i.e. intermediate storage) format.  It  is also commonly used for video resources on the internet.

**File Group - Thumbnails** -  this group produces JPEG images files, captured every few seconds, from the input video.  Thumbnail images can be used for presentaion of the video in websites or as input to downstream tasks such as analytics with Amazon Rekognition. 

### Detailed Instructions

#### Create the job with only the MP4 output 

At this point, we will test our job settings with just the MP4 output to make sure everything is working.  In the next step, we will create a duplicate job and add the HLS and Thumbnails outputs.  This step is not nescessary, but lets us test our role and bucket permissions without having to input alot of settings.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Create**
2. Wait for the job to complete.  Monitor the status of the job by refreshing the **Job summary** page using the **refresh** button. 

    ![Save the Job ID](../images/mediaconvert-save-jobid.png)

#### Duplicate the job from the previous section

1. From the **Job summary** page for the job that just completed, select the **Duplicate** button.  This creates a new job with the same settings as the original job.

#### Add an Apple HLS Output Group

1. Under **Output Groups** on the Job panel, select **Add**.
2. Check the **Apple HLS** box then click on **Select**.
3. Make sure **Apple HLS** is selected in the Job panel in the Output groups section so that Apple HLS form is loaded.
4. Fill in `HLS` in the **Custom group name** box.
5. Use the bucket name you saved from the previous module to construct the output S3 path as follows:
